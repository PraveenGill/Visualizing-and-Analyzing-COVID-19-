# Visualizing-and-Analyzing-COVID-19-
Data Analysis of COVID-19 and Vaccination data using python 

In this project, we pre-process datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for analysis.In this project, we are going to work with COVID-19 dataset of diffrent states in India, which consists the number of confirmed cases,cured, deaths, state/union territotry etc. Also, we have another dataset consists of vaccination,providing data about first dose, second dose,male(dose adminidtered),female(dose admistered), state, etc. We are going to use these two dataset collectivelly and analyze the covid-19 panademic effect and vaccination process.

We would use python libraries and statsical formulas to get insights from the data using pandas and visualize them using matplotlib * and *seaborn library.
Steps Followed:
 1. Importing required libraries
 2. Download and know you dataset
 3. Dropping Unnecssary columns
 4. Getting Insights and Visualization
